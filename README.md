# ChordEncoder_VHDL
 The Verilog code implements a musical chord encoder circuit. It takes individual notes of three-note or four-note chords as input and converts them into their respective chord names. The code handles incoming byte data representing musical notes and modifiers (sharp or flat) on each positive transition of an external clock cycle. It determines chord types (major, minor, suspended triads, and dominant 7ths) based on the input notes' positions relative to the root note. Additionally, it incorporates a buffering mechanism to account for input data rate variations and ensure accurate chord identification within specified constraints. The circuit's functionality is verified using a testbench environment to ensure correct output generation according to specified rules for printing chord names. Overall, the code demonstrates problem-solving skills and attention to detail in resolving challenges related to clock synchronization, data processing, and output formatting within the project constraints.
